* With its built-in utilities and features, EzyAI-Framework offers:

  * Rapid development: Pre-built components and templates allow you to quickly build and deploy your AI applications.
  * Simplified deployment: Streamlined integration with FastAPI enables hassle-free deployment of your applications.
  * Increased productivity: EzyAI-Framework handles the complexities of code optimization and infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on the core functionality of your application.
  * Time saving: Reduces the time to implement your generative AI solutions, allowing you to focus on innovation and creativity.
* EzyAI-Framework is the ideal solution for developers and researchers looking to build and deploy generative AI applications quickly and efficiently.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following software to be installed:

Python 3.9 or higher
To install Python, you can follow the instructions on the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You can check your Python version by running the following command:
```
python --version
```
In addition to Python, you may also need to install additional dependencies depending on the specific project requirements. These dependencies will typically be listed in a requirements.txt file within the project directory.

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once you have installed all of the prerequisites, you should be able to run the project code.

Additional notes
* If you are using a virtual environment, make sure that you activate it before installing the dependencies.
* If you encounter any errors while installing the dependencies, you can try searching for solutions online or asking for help on a community forum such as Stack Overflow.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
1. Clone the repository: 
``` 
git clone https://ezyai-demo-190848466027-git.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev/ezyai-demos/ezyai-framework.git 
```
2. Change directory to the cloned repo:
```
cd ezyai-framework
```
3. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. You should now be able to run the project code! For example:
```
python main.py
```
7. Once the above command it run it will start serving the Application endpoint on [localhost](http://localhost:5000)
8. The Current Setup runs multiple endpoints which server UI,APIs,Swagger


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. The Framework comprises of multiple utilities and skeleton framework which can be used to setup and deploy GenAI applications 
2. The Structure of Framework is divided in 3 subfolders - Frontend, Backend, Router
    * Router - This directory contains all routes that are being servered as part of the webserver
    * Frontend - This Directory contains all Code and templates to render a frontend for the GenAI Application
    * Backend - This Directory contains all the python utilities and structure which are requried to run a GenAI application
3. To utilise the framework the requested directories would need to be modified based on the use case with appropriate business logic Implementations


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

1. The code repository contains a Dockerfile which servers as its instruction 
2. Dockerfile can be used to build the container image for the application using the below command 
```
docker build -t <Name of the image> .
```
3. Once image is created it can be stored in a Image respository such as [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)
4. Using the Container Image the Application can be deployed to services like [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run),[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine),[AppEngine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)
